# Hi! I'm Charly!

I live in sunny Lisbon ☀️ where I design and build apps. I've been working remotely as a software developer since 2016.

🛠️ Current favorite stack: TypeScript + Next.js + Prisma + Tailwind CSS

⚡ Looking to work with companies having a strong mission, team culture, and unique work environment

🧡 Music and the outdoors are big passions of mine!

<!-- 🌳 Today, my main focus is to work with companies aiming to protect or regenerate ecosystems on our beautiful planet. -->

<!-- 🥁 Music is also a passion of mine. As a drummer and DJ, I would be thrilled to work with artists or companies in this space. -->
