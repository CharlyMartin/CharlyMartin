# Hi! I'm Charly!

I live in sunny Lisbon ☀️ where I design and build apps. I've been working remotely as a frontend developer since 2016.

🛠️ Current favourite stack: TypeScript + Next.js + Tailwind CSS

🌳 Today, my main focus is to work with companies aiming to protect or regenerate ecosystems on our beautiful planet.

🥁 Music is also a passion of mine. As a drummer and DJ, I would be thrilled to work with artists or companies in this space.

Sounds like we can be a good match? I would love to hear from you at [charly@hey.com](mailto:charly@hey.com?subject=Your%20Github%20Profile)

Alternatively, you can read more about me and what I do at [charlymartin.me](https://charlymartin.me?utm_source=github_profile).
