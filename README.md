# Hi! I'm Charly!

I live in sunny Lisbon ☀️ where I design and build apps. I've been working as a frontend developer since 2016.

🛠️ Current favourite stack: TypeScript + Next.js + Tailwind CSS

⭐ Interests: I would love to work with companies protecting nature and biodiversity. I'm also passionate about music and would really enjoy working with artists in this space.
